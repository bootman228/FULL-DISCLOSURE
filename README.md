# FULL-DISCLOSURE
Subject: kinger90210 | Claim: FULL DISCLOSURE

FULL TEXT BELOW:

I talked with some of the most high frequency posters of r/UFOs about how to do this for months.

Here is the plan:

I will give you full disclosure in 2 parts. If you are really interested.

My promise: I won’t do interviews. I won’t sell books. I won’t start a weird cult. I will not have profit or any gain from it.

I will just give you full disclosure.

But that’s not easy because:

You would call it a larp, downvote it to hell and moved on. I would need to make sure that you can verify my claims. So I need to make sure that you can see everything with your own eyes. 

I will not make vague claims. If I claim something, I will do it very precise, for example give a exact location and not a vague claim like: „yeah UFOs are build in Mexico“. I will exactly tell you where and how, and more.

The most important part will be, that I make sure you can experience / see this for yourself.

This Disclosure post will not work if I just make a rumbling post which will give you 5 strokes and has 200 weird claims. Else It will be just another Anjali, Lazar type of story.

I promise I will give my best to archive that in 2 single posts. And that’s it. 2 posts and we are done. It’s up to you to research and fact check it. And probably to see it for yourself. You don’t need to buy anything, you don’t need to believe any narrative, you can archive this on your own.

____Table of contents:____

Part1:

0. how we influenced the UFO community before (some funny reveals, it’s not that important)

1. my own witness testimony 
2. „alien abduction“. My own experience (no I wasn’t abducted)
3. Who is this Monroe guy?
4. What are UFOS. 
5. Locations and more 
6. The whole story
7. How you can verify this 

______


If this announcement gets enough upvotes and friendly comments, iam ready to do this. I have nothing to gain from it. You will have the same information as Lue Elizondo afterwards. If you are rude or this announcement gets downvoted to hell, no problem, then it wasn’t the right time or I started this wrong. We have decades of time to bring this information out to anyone who is interested.

Love 

Ps: the part 1 of 2
Would be posted tomorrow and part 2 like 1-2 days later

____part 1____

Iam from Germany, English is not my main language, but I don’t want to use translation tools or let someone translate this into grammatically perfect English. Maybe it could change the outcome of the text and how I meant it. So I’m sorry in advance for your hard time reading this, I promise it will be worth it.

Let’s start:

Sometimes the best way to tell a story is if you tell it from the point of view of a main character. But let me state that Iam not special, and I don’t have any special abilities. Iam not better as you, and it is very possible that you will have a different opinion afterwards as me and you could also be right. There is no 100% truth. We all see things differently and even if we watch an event, and see the same outcome we have different opinions about it. What you call reality might not the reality that I or someone else experiences.

So I will do it in a way, that you can follow my experience step by step, I will break it down as detailed as possible and then I want you, to research it. Be sceptic. Be a real researcher. It doesn’t matter what I will claim as fact, the important part will be, can you verify it? You don’t need to believe a single word, all I can promise is, if you really want disclosure, i can show you how you will archive it for your own.

You dont need a ufo prophet or pay money for disclosure. Information is always free. Everyone that wants you to pay for something, has not the best intentions for you, only for himself.

_______

___ 0. how we influenced the UFO community before (some funny reveals, it’s not that important)___

The title could be also called: „who am I“, but that would sound arrogant.

Iam a Frequent Poster in this sub. UFOs are one of my passions. Iam also active on other platforms. On none of these platforms I have a financial gain of this topic.

I made some little mistakes before. For example I claimed that lue Elizondo was trained in remote viewing before it was public knowledge. I also mentioned where he was trained etc. Sometimes I forgot what’s „Public“ knowledge and what not.

I was also the anonymous person who started it. I or better „we“ was / are the person who asked the super Chat question and made Lue Elizondo a couple seconds speechless. The remote viewing question. You can research this. It was a big topic back then.

„We“ do that on purpose. If we think it’s time for example that the ufo community should start discuss and research remote viewing, we will point the current discussion for the upcoming weeks in that direction. You probably remember all the remote viewing talks and posts back then. (Note that remote viewing was a simple tool for you to understand the bigger reality. In my humble opinion remote viewing is way to inaccurate to be helpful for real disclosure which can be scientifically proven). We also did that with all the consciousness talk later on. Etc etc 

So you see, some people try (!) to pull at least some strings to point you guys in the right direction.

This won’t change the world. But don’t underestimate all the people that you and me influence everyday with every thought that we speak out.

You will also find me in other interviews. I do Postings on my own. Also some of your favorite ufo guys are in contact with me and with others.

We all are part of a loose group. I would call it slow disclosure movement. And maybe so are you. As long as your intention is pure and with a positive meaning. „Each one, teach one“.- (was a famous graffiti slogan in berlin.)

Let me give you an example: I don’t believe Lazar. Jeremy Corbell does. We follow each other on different social media channels. I like his passion about this subject.

I still think that Lazar helped our community and the progress very much. Iam thankful. And still my opinion is that he is a fraud.
Simple as that. That’s how I roll. 

But there is a difference between his personality and mine. I don’t want to earn a single cent and I will never take part in any Public stuff. And I try it with the truth.

___ 1. my own witness testimony ____


Age: between 12-14. now I’m 34.
Place: Germany, Iam at home. It’s in the Middle of the biggest district of my city, I live in a kind of skyscraper 5th Floor. 
Between 14-16 o clock (2-4pm afternoon.) broad daylight.

Iam playing with a red ball, like a Tennisball. Iam shooting the Ball against the window. Then I see it. There is something and it has lights.

I look outside of the window. Now right in front of me is a UFO. And with UFO I mean a flying saucer. Metallic. Size of a helicopter. I see it absolutely clearly. It’s only 10 meters away. I can see every cm / inch of the flying saucer. It’s right in line of sight, the same height as my position of view. It’s like the perfect and best view you could imagine.

I had not seen something like that before. Even the Metal looks like something I never saw before. It is very slowly hovering from left to right. It has 3 lights under it. But lights is the wrong word, it was light-like. It was like 3 glowing points under it, they was hypnotically blinking. From left to right: red, blue, green. And then the cycle of blinking starts again. Red on the left, then blue in the middle, then green on the right side under it. And again and again. It was very (!) hypnotic to watch it.

Now iam screaming. As loud as I can.

My mother which was 1 room away, immediately run into my room and probably thought I broke my leg or something while playing with the red ball inside my room.

She’s looking at me and asking what’s wrong?

I don’t answer and just look outside. She joins me and stands now next to me, on my right.

We both now watch this flying saucer hover very slowly by, it shakes a bit while it moved. No sound. Nobody says a single word.

Again I repeat: I see every cm / inch of it. Only probably 10 meters away. Perfect view. 

If you see this, you recognize it’s not from this World. The hovering, the shaking, the pulsating, the hypnotic glowing from the lights. Even the surface (metallic) looks „unreal“.

It now hovers very slowly by (took up to 5 minutes I guess)

My mother leaves my room without saying a single word.

Later that day my dad comes home (one of the highest police officers in our city).

I hear her talking to him about it. He believes her and says just dont talk about it.

And that’s it.
______

____ 2. „alien abduction“. My own experience (no I wasn’t abducted)____

Let me get this straight because this is important. I was and Iam 100% sure without any doubt what i saw with every detail was a UFO not from this „world“. This was not manmade. This was not a hallucination. I thought about every single explanation for this event, the result was always the same, this was a ufo and this was not human.

So.. Iam very young, iam terrified. I start now to research. Every book, every article in the internet, every comment on every website on every board.

But my fear and what Iam terrified about was not UFOs. It was aliens. Because my thought process was: if I know for a fact that UFOs exist. Then aliens also exist.

And if some of these ufo story’s are true, what about these alien abduction story’s?

How can I be 100% sure that UFOs exist and call all these alien abductees liar’s ?

So Iam afraid what will happen next. All these guys claim they saw UFOs and got abducted later. Will this happen also to me?

I was fucking terrified. I did nothing bad. Why would something like that happen to me? I don’t want that ! I don’t want that to happen. I would get a heart attack if that happens to me.

So, the next months, or probably 1-2 years Iam very afraid to fall sleep. (This will be important later). I think it was very important for the disclosure that i will give you later, that I didn’t want to fall asleep.

But before we come to that. There was an event one night.

Iam in my bed, it’s very late at night, as always I couldn’t sleep because I was scared. And then, I Heard foot steps. It’s like 2-3 guys are just walking in my bedroom. My heart starts racing, my head was under my bedcover / duvet as always. One hand was outside the bedcover. I was to scared to pull my hand in at that moment.

Then something very cold (probably) metallic touched my hand. I nearly got a heart attack. In the Next Second I pass out or fall asleep, I don’t know.

Then I had a dream that I was floating above my bed. The typical grey aliens next to me also floating in the air. One next to me, smiling at met, friendly. We all start now float Torwarts the window.

Then in my mind I screamed no and it felt like one of these dreams were you think you fall down. A lot of people remember the feeling before you wake up, you feel like you fall down (this will also be important later).

I woke up the next morning. What did happen?….

Then on the afternoon my heart was racing again. I really found a couple of alien abduction story’s  that state that they saw aliens/greys in their room and they had a sort of metal rod and touched the abductee before the abduction. They passed out and that’s it.

But is this really what happened? I tried to stay rational. And the explanation was science. What happened was the following: my body was very tired and my mind didn’t want to fall asleep. So I got sleep paralysis and witnessed the hypnagogic state. Your brain will play tricks on you and you will see and feel things that aren’t there. Just research hypnagogic state and sleep paralysis.

And the alien dream? Well my brain obviously thinking about and dreaming about it, because that was my biggest concern/fear and I thought about nothing else before I got to sleep.

So does that mean all alleged alien abductions are not „real“? I don’t say that.

 But this story was important because it pointed me to disclosure, full disclosure.

It is also very important to show that Iam very familiar with the hypnagogic state and sleep paralysis.

It was one single comment, or one single post, who changed everything:

I don’t remember exactly what he was saying it was something like this: „you had an out of body experience, you know, a kind of astralprojection„ while he was discussing with an alleged abductee.

I was like: what is he even talking about? Astralprojection? out of body experience? 

This changed everything.

So i read about this and researched it. And this was absolutely impossible. People claim they could leave their body’s and go wherever they want? This had to be absolutely nonsense. But it sounded so interesting. So I kept researching it. Again I read every comment, bought every book. I mean, let’s keep it simple: if they claim this, then I can fact check it? If they can do this, I should also can do this? I could simply prove this for myself if these people tell the truth or not.

I was the perfect candidate for that. Your body should be deeply relaxed and your mind should be awake. I was doing the last months/years nothing else every night. My body was trying to get his sleep and my mind wanted to stay awake (because of my irrational fear of aliens coming) 

So I should have no problem to do this? It’s like I trained for it since years anyway.

________

___ 3. Who is this Monroe guy?___

Wherever and whatever you read, there was always this name, Monroe, bob Monroe, Robert Monroe. He was the out of body experience guy, the astral projection guy. He was literally THE guy.

Whenever they talked on these websites and boards about this topic, you always would read his name or references to him.

I bought his books. I read all 3 in only a couple of days/weeks. 

I read his instructions / guidance and all the other „manuals“ out there, on how to leave your body.

It didn’t work. It didn’t work for a day. It didn’t work for weeks. It didn’t work for months.

That’s it. It was a dumb idea. How could I believe this and spend even money on stupid books about how to leave my body.

I stopped trying it. It was ridiculous to even try it in the beginning. This would be the biggest news in the world, this would change literally everything. I could spy my neighbors, I could walk on the moon or even the sun if this would be real. I could survive death. I could…. The possibilities and everything else would be literally mind blowing.

And then it happened.

One morning, months later…

I just woke up. I kept my eyes closed, my body was still pretty much relaxed or still asleep. Only my mind was slowly waking up.
I thought about these out of body stuff and gave it another try. I was focusing on the sound in my ears, you know that blood pressure or frequency or whatever you hear when everything else is quiet.

And then it happened, the strongest feeling I ever experienced. It was like a lightning hit me, my whole body was vibrating, it atleast felt like that. This was so intense it really felt like I was getting electric shocks. It just stayed like that for a couple of seconds till I remembered that I have to try to make it slower and faster, move it up and down. It was very easy, first try, I managed to make it go from my head to my toes and back up and back down and slow it down and speed it up. Till these vibrations went so fast that… wait.. what’s happening? I was starting to float. I was fully conscious! I was floating. I stopped. Iam floating in the air. Everything is exactly like this Monroe guy and all the thousands others described.

I saw my bedroom now and my physical body. But I didn’t watched it threw my eyes. I saw the room as a whole. It was like I was seeing the room from every perspective at once. Like a 4D (?) view? And the colours were also different.

I panicked and I had the feeling of falling down / snapping back in my body. The same feeling you have in these dreams. These fall down dreams.

I was back into my body, this was not a dream. It really happened. And maybe you ask how real it was? It was more real as the physical experience you or me have right now. It was not only real, it was more real as this feeling you have right now while you read this.

This fucking Monroe guy was a genius I thought. How fucking brave was he to experience this without getting any help? Nobody he could ask or beg for help. And wait… all the other things that mean this. I don’t need a physical body? Why am I then in this physical body? Holy shit. 10000s of thoughts are in my mind the next days. I have to read every word in his book again, nobody will believe me this.

But I was wrong, a lot of people believed this, thousands of people that also did this, every night.

They did this. Every night. And sometimes in the morning or afternoon.

And it’s not a handful of people, it could be hundreds of thousands of them. While atleast that’s how much claim they do this like me on the internet. How much of them are not in the internet?

But wait… I could also get every ufo Information that I ever was curious about now? But wait: I can view them for myself? My mind was blown. Distance was not longer a problem and so wasn’t time a problem? Except for the future.

I need to repeat this. On different times a day. With different tasks for me. I need to validate if that what I see is real. For example watch my sister (while I’m out of body) and ask her afterwards if that what I saw was what happened.

I would be never at this point, without the ufo that I saw and my irrational fear of aliens and the research that all this started.

So this was what this Jacques Vallee guy was talking about. That was the reason why I saw this ufo?
The only purpose was to interact with me (let me seeing it) to led me to this point. That’s the control system. It really had a positive impact on me in every way. And all this without breaking my free will. It was my decision to research all this, and the catalyst was seeing this ufo.

I found out that (my estimation) around 99% of UFOs are thought forms. Send out as a thought form by someone from somewhere. Acting as a control system for human consciousness. They look how they look because you would else not think it’s a real ufo. That’s why the UFOs looked different from decade to decade. Currently you would be more stunned by a tic tac ufo instead of a flying saucer type. They create some sort of mystery to mankind, it will let you question everything, these types of UFOs are of a kind of positive interaction. 

____

So what is your next step now? Iam talking to you while you read this. Will you laugh about this? Make fun of it? You should take a step back and see: your whole life people probably made fun of you, or at least about the topic you think that is real and should taken more serious. Could you talk about UFOs publicly without getting „these“ looks? 
Was you called a weirdo for believing in UFOs? How mad are you about people who don’t take this phenomenon serious and laugh about it. Will you do the same now? What about the over 200.000 members of the r/astralprojection sub, are they all idiots and weirdos like people think about you and others who believe in UFOs? Or will you break this cycle? Will you research and try to proof me wrong or right? You don’t believe me or you will be rude? Let me quote Robert Bigelow here: „I don’t care“. There will be no aliens landing at the front gate of the White House. Disclosure will be up to you. And I will show you why. And I will answer „every“ question you ever had about UFOs in these 2 posts.

Do you think it’s coincidence that Bigelow is shifting his research from UFOs to study’s of consciousness? What does he know that you don’t know?

What about the Monroe institute in Virginia, named after Robert Monroe. Why did the CIA sent their agents there to get trained in what exactly?

Why all these consciousness research and references made by your favorite UFOs guys? What does Lue Elizondo really know about the universe? And what is he hinting always? Was it Remote viewing only? And where? What did he found out. I will show you.

___4. What are UFOS. ___

As I said, in my estimation around 99% of UFOs are thought forms. Created by someone from somewhere. I already tried to describe the purpose of it.

Are there physical UFOs made by aliens? Space ships? Made for physical travel in our physical universe? 

Yes, but let me say that this kind of traveling is very primitive. Physical travel is very primitive. And it is very rare in the universe. Yes there also was physical vehicles controlled by aliens in our atmosphere, but that’s a very very low number. There also was physical landings and abductions. Very rare cases. Let me repeat that physical traveling and physical vehicles are a primitive way of traveling.

Did UFOs really crash?

Yes. And no. 

Let me say it like this: UFOs are so advanced that they don’t crash. Even if it’s a physical vehicle there is no way it could crash or get shot down, not even with EMPs. UFOs don’t crash. But still we really have crashed vehicles.

It was a trick. They crashed on purpose. Think about where the alleged Roswell crash happened? How many and which army bases are next to it? What a big coincidence that a UFO from out of this world crashed next to these military bases.

This technology was given in that way for negative purpose. For war. 

Why keep this secret? Military advantage for the next thousand years.

You are correct if you thought that the USA has these in underwater bases. The remote viewing session that Kit Green did was accurate, I can approve that.

The United States for example, is not using this as a transport vehicle. They are very small. They are remote controlled. They are only used as a weapon. Engine Type is of Electro magnetic.

The USA has currently about 760 of these.

They get build in Mexico. By the United States of USA. Underground location. The property / ground got bought by the USA. It’s officially a bacteriological warfare research installation. If you research there is a possibility you find this location even without astral projection / out of body experience. The „blackvault“ should have some fun with this :) please note that Iam not in possession of coordinates, because of how i obtained this knowledge, but Iam
Pretty sure I can find it physically and it should be possible to find it via good research. Then you would also know who is running this base etc 


Now you get an idea why there is a fight between keeping this a secret or to disclosure it. And why both sides have good arguments on why to keep things like this or to disclosure all this for good of mankind.

____

This is the end of part 1. it was very important to me that you get an idea where I got this information from and how you can verify it.

Part 2 will be more precise. Will answer a lot of UFO specific questions, will talk about alien abduction’s, famous cases, locations, the whole big picture / story etc. I changed the table content a bit while writing this.

I know that big claims require big evidence. Iam and others are ready to also prove this scientifically. Only rule would be: no financial gain and no fame, I want to live my life on without being a target for weirdos and others; and without having profit from this subject. There are hundreds of people who are more advanced as iam. As far as I know these kind of study’s are also already running with slow progress.

Please also note that I focus on positive UFO things instead of negative UFO interactions, fear spreading would be the wrong way in my opinion.

Sorry for the grammatical mistakes and the bad English :)


Love
----------------------------------------------------------
Before we start, we will take a step backwards, and try to answer this question: how real and how accurate is the information presented? 

You probably never read any study’s about remote viewing or Out of Body Experience before. I will quote the conclusion of Dr Charles Tart:

____

„Six Studies of Out-of-Body Experiences
Charles T. Tart, Ph.D.
Institute of Tanspersonal Psychology, Palo Alto, CA University of California at Davis“

„Conclusion
So what is an OBE? Does the mind or soul really leave the body and go somewhere else, "out," or is the OBE just a special altered state of consciousness that is basically hallucinatory in nature? That is, is the feeling and conviction that you are elsewhere than your physical body's location an illusion? After decades of reflection on the results of my own and others' research (Alvarado, 1982a, 1982b, 1984, 1986, 1989; Blackmore, 1984, 1994; Gabbard and Twemlow, 1984; Gackenbach, 1991; Green, 1968; Grosso, 1976; Irwin, 1985, 1988; Krippner, 1994; McCreery and Claridge, 1995; Morris, 1974; Osis and McCormick, 1980; Osis and Mitchell, 1977; Palmer, 1994; Palmer and Vassar, 1974; Rogo, 1978; Stanford, 1987; Walsh, 1989), particularly in the light of my studies on the nature of consciousness and altered states, I have a more complex view of OBEs that includes both of these possibilities at different times and more.
I believe that in some OBEs, the mind may, at least partially, really be located elsewhere than the physical body; this may have been the case with Miss Z. At the opposite extreme, as with my virtuoso hyp notic subjects whose experience was vivid and perfectly real to them but whose perception of the target room was only illusory, I believe an OBE can be a simulation of being out of the body, with the mind as much "in" the physical body as it ever is. In between these two extremes, I believe we can have OBEs that are basically a simulation of being out, but which are informed by information gathered by ESP such that the simulation of the OBE location is accurate and veridi cal. This is a messy situation in some ways, especially because all three of these types of OBEs may seem experientially identical to the person having them, at least at rough levels of description. While I would prefer reality to fall into simple, clear cut categories, I have learned in life that reality is often complex.“

____

I have to be a sceptic to myself and of my own experience. We know since quantum physics that the observer interferes. Is there a possibility my mind makes these things up? Is there a possibility that the data observed is influenced by me or just not accurate?

This is absolutely possible. To make sure the data is accurate i have to repeat it over and over again. If I view a target or place, I have to do it over and over again. Simply as that.

I need to keep always in mind that my own believe system (everyone of you has its own) will always be a part of it, and I need to filter everything neutral out. There are also a lot of problems in this state, like having the right location at the right time. You are not always in the physical „realm“ at this current time. Consciousness is not bound to space or time.

The only way to produce accurate data is to have reference points and as I mentioned to repeat it, till the outcome is always the same and is observed in a way that an interference between the observer and the object or location is out of the question.


_____

So if consciousness is not bound to space or time, you could go wherever and whenever you want right?

If so, my data shows the following:

This physical universe was created by a thought.

I always wondered how out of nothing a bigbang can occur and years later planets and humans can exist. Humans who are aware of their surroundings. Beings who can love.

I could not gather any data who made this thought. An infinite creator? God? Aliens? Was it us? I can only rely on what I can perceive. And this is that it started with a single thought that created this physical universe.

Why do I start with such a unscientific statement?

Because thoughts are more important as our modern science can even imagine.

All physical matter, all objects, are created by thoughts. I can’t prove that scientifically, and it will take a lot of decades till this can get scientifically reproduced, but it is still important that I say this.

____

_____UFOs and Aliens (thought forms)____

Alien abductions are real. Encounters with physical beings are very rare. 

The absolute most of these are happening in an out of body kind of state:

Negative beings separate the astral body (consciousness) from the physical body. Your consciousness gets transferred to a different place. Different layers of hypnosis will implanted in your mind / consciousness.
This can only happen if you are very weak minded and are open to such things. This can’t happen against your will. Like you know it from human types of induced hypnosis.

Nearly all encounters with alien beings are negative. The Ariel school encounter was also with negative beings. They used telepathic communication to show harmful things in the mind of these kids. It was meant to spread fear.

Positive alien beings don’t interact openly with mankind, they respect our freewill. They only show themself as thoughts forms (UFO types) to our consciousness.

Maybe I can say it more simple: alien encounters are mostly negative. Most ufo encounters have a positive background.

This makes more sense when you realize that aliens don’t travel in UFOs. Well mostly. Some really do this (primitive type) but only very rare. Most other intelligent lifeforms are so advanced that they don’t need physical vehicles anymore.

Telepathic communication is very natural in this universe. Humans are out of the norm.

___


-Thought forms are no type of hallucination. 
-Thought forms can be detected on radar. 
-Thought forms manifest as physical reality so you can perceive them.

I estimated that around 99% of UFO activity are thought forms. I stated that traveling in physical vehicles with physical body’s is very primitive. 

Thought forms are not just created out of thin air. For organic thought forms like „aliens“ you would need organic parts. example: cattle parts

For ufo thought forms sorts of calcium and magnesium are used. Could be wrong here, but these 2 are also mentioned in dozens of cases that I read, hard to point out just from the looks. So in this case, take my best guess.

Till today I have no idea how they really do this.

I also stated that it is a type of control system for consciousness.

I agree with Jacques Vallee:

„Jacques Vallee (1975) hypothesized that the UFO phenomenon is an element in a control system. The control system uses various absurdities that people experience to change the mythology that we have about reality. He believes that there is an intelligence involved, that there are physical manifestations, and that there is also a deep psychic dimension.“


So if you ever wondered how these UFOs/objects enter our planet / realm / dimension. And how they instantly vanish. You got now your explanation.


It seems that these objects are actually thought forms. That’s at least what my data shows. 
That doesn’t mean they aren’t real. They are as real as you and me, but they are different from what you probably expected.

It seems that „they“ create a thought construct which manifests as physical reality. Biological and or physical parts are used. The process how exactly this happens  is unknown to me. I can only observe this, i am sorry. So a ufo (thought form) is also sort of a real vehicle which has also to be align with our physical laws.

Currently (to my research) the USA and Russia are both in possession of such material. Both got their fair share of crashed vehicles (multiple).

Tom DeLonge did not lie. Everything he said and mentioned so far is exactly what he and his sources believe. That doesn’t mean I agree with all of it, it does mean, that the data they have, pointed them to the conclusion of otherworldly beings with negative influence. This is only partly correct. It will be answered later on, in the last part.

Also i want to quote this:

„Former Israeli space security chief says extraterrestrials exist
A "galactic federation" has been waiting for humans to "reach a stage where we will understand... what space and spaceships are," „Haim Eshed“

This is only very loosely correct but has a true core.  

Both of them are right. The zoo theory is not correct but yes we get observed. But observed is the wrong word. Every thought you ever had is known. There are no secrets. And that’s it.

and that’s also why you and me, can travel out of body to every place and every event and observe it. Or remote view it. Information is free. For everyone.

Underwater base near Catalina Island is definitely true and also Lue Elizondo is in possession of this knowledge, so are others.
His knowledge about this is not from remote viewing. 


Greys as you call them, react to somebody who astral projects to them or remote views them, the same as a women would react to seeing a cockroach in her house.

Thousands of thousands of different kinds of them with different agendas.

For such informations I use a „info“. You ask directly for it (in your mind with a strong intense) and you see it as a kind of movie, but not movie screen, more like a 3 D version of a movie where you can see it from every angle and also thoughts are no secret. You feel a strong pull into a direction and then you immediately stop and watch it. That’s how I gather on most of these informations.

I review the same event sometimes a dozen times from different point of views till I think that I got the information accurate / correct. 

For physical places here, if I want to validate where this „here“ is, I will travel around that area and search for informations like signs or anything remarkable.
For physical places or persons it would be useful to be there before or have an emotional connection to that person, like met this person once. 

These are 2 different variants of doing it.

My only goal was to help anyone who was interested in the truth. I have to repeat: 
there will never be a ufo land in front of the White House.
We will never see or detect aliens via a telescope.
Even if you would see the manmade UFOs built by the USA, which are capable of outperforming everything known, this will be no proof for aliens.
Disclosure will never happen. Not in the way you expect it to happen.
Disclosure will be only possible if you overcome your fear and try to experience and research it on your own. I gave you the tools to it, all you need to do is to overcome your fear and try it and research it. Don’t wait for the next new interview or podcast or news article that will provide you full disclosure. You are the only one in possession of full disclosure, it’s up to you to see for yourself how true my claims are.

Our physical system is isolated. It is not possible to reach planets with aliens with rockets or space ships. It is meant to be like this. Yes you can travel to other planets, even other solar systems. But in this way it is not possible to find other intelligent lifeforms.

Also: The absolute most intelligent lifeforms don’t have physical body’s.
But advanced ones can create physical vehicles to operate in our physical environment.

Disclosure can only happen in that one way. That you and everyone else break this cycle. Or the last 70 years will repeat over and over again. And so the last 700 years. And so on.

We are like children who are isolated in their kindergarten. We do good things, we do bad things. Interference is only needed when the keeper things it is necessary.
We are here to learn, to love. We are the universe experiencing itself.

Did you ever wonder why a good God would build a world where the only way to survive is by taking life?

How long would you stay alive if you refused to eat? You may love animals and grow plants inside your home and flowers in your garden, but every time you eat, you destroy the life of something. A something with a consciousness, that feels and desires to live, as we do.

The other day I grabbed an onion from a basket to chop up, and I saw it had sprouted a beautiful, tender, light-green shoot. It had a life inside it, a consciousness that wanted to take root, breathe air and thrive. Any tears in chopping that onion did not come from the fumes.

I’m not a sentimentalist. I’m a person questioning, increasingly aware of an insidious thread woven through biological life. We are born, we feed, and we die. Life is a process of consuming other living things in order to stay alive as long as possible until death in turn consumes us. We tell ourselves life is a whole lot more, but it’s reduced to that as long as we must feed to survive. If we can’t stay alive more than a few months without food, how can eating not be fundamental to how we define our existence?

Eating is a requirement for biological life as we know it. It’s the thread that holds together material existence. More than a thread, it’s a chain, binding us to the law that we must consume each other. Rebelling is punishable by death.

What kind of God or gods would create a world predicated on killing? We don’t like to ask that, and we find every excuse to avoid looking at this question. But every time a dear one dies, or you find a nibbled bird in the yard destroyed by an idle cat, or you read about an animal that has suffered mercilessly, or another molested child, or a nation ravaged by a quake that’s buried thousands of living people, your mind goes back to that nagging question. Who would make a world like this? Was it truly a God of love?

According to much evidence, it wasn’t. The world was created by something else. Or if it was created by the loving God our hearts insist exists, then creation has been tampered with by someone else so merciless that it barely resembles the original divine vision. The biological universe is controlled by the law that to live we must take life or die. That is sinister. Something there is that makes us have to eat, that makes us age and disintegrate. This is the “something wrong with the world,” the crack in the universe. Knowledge of it works “like a splinter in the mind, driving you mad,” quoting “The Matrix.” Yet awakening to the truth of our predicament is the first step toward radical change. Only radical change can possibly right the fundamental flaw woven into physical creation.

And how well-woven it is. Not only does violence wind through the lives of all Earth life like the fibers of a time-bomb attached to a victim. It reaches out into space, where supernovas implode, collapsing millions of stars along with all living beings on all their attendant planets. Death and devouring are so pervasive most people can’t conceive of a world without them, or if they can conceive it, they label the concept preposterous. Yet quantum physics shows that matter is nothing but atoms: emptiness vibrating. Emptiness does not die and neither does the energy it oscillates. So why must bodies die that are made of up of these things?

Robert Monroe, in his book “Far Journeys,” writes of contact he had with a light being in an out-of-body experience. (Monroe is arguably the world’s foremost researcher on OBEs; he started an institute with trainee/researchers to scientifically investigate the phenomenon.) Reportedly the light being told Monroe that when humans die, their energy is released and harvested by trans-dimensional beings, who use it to extend their own life spans. The claim is that the universe is a garden created by these beings as their food source.

According to Monroe’s story, animals are intentionally positioned on this planet to feed on plants and on each other, thereby releasing the life force of their victims so it can be harvested. In a predator-prey struggle, exceptional energy is produced in the combatants. The spilling of blood in a fight-to-the-death conflict releases this intense energy, which the light beings call “loosh.” Loosh is also harvested from the loneliness of animals and humans, as well as from the emotions engendered when a parent is forced to defend the life of its young. Another source of loosh is humans’ worship.

According to Monroe’s informant, our creators, the cosmic “energy farmers,” intentionally equipped animals with devices like fangs, claws and super-speed in order to prolong predator-prey combat and thereby produce more loosh. In other words, the greater the suffering, the more life force is spewed from our bodies, and the tastier the energy meal for our creators.

This story told to Monroe (which threw him into a two-week depression) corresponds to reports in some of the world’s oldest scriptures, the Vedas, Upanishads, and Puranas of India. There we read that “the universe is upheld by sacrifice” (Atharva Veda) and that “all who are living (in this world) are the sacrificers. There is none living who does not perform yagya (sacrifice). This body is (created) for sacrifice, and arises out of sacrifice and changes according to sacrifice.” (Garbha Upanishad)

Again:

“(Death as the Creator) resolved to devour all that he had created; for he eats all. . . He is the eater of the whole universe; this whole universe is his food.” (Mahabharata)

In the writings of Carlos Castaneda, who chronicles the life and teachings of a Yaquii sorcerer called Don Juan, we find another story of the Divine devouring humans, in this case human consciousness. Reports Castaneda:

“The Eagle is devouring the awareness of all the creatures that, alive on earth a moment before and now dead, have floated to the Eagle’s beak, like a ceaseless swarm of fireflies, to meet their owner, their reason for having had life. The Eagle disentangles these tiny flames, lays them flat, as a tanner stretches out a hide, and then consumes them; for awareness is the Eagle’s food. The Eagle, that power that governs the destinies of all living things, reflects equally and at once all those living things.” (“The Eagle’s Gift,” by Carlos Castaneda)

The idea that man must sacrifice (must kill something or be killed in order to appease the gods) is apparently intrinsic to all the world’s root religions. We find blood ritual, including human sacrifice, in the Druidic tradition, Tibetan Buddhism, among the Indians of the Americas, in Greece and Rome, Africa, China, Arabia, Germany, Phoenicia and Egypt. Even the Old Testament (Judges 11:31-40) has a little-advertised story of human sacrifice, with the Israelite judge Jephthah ritually slaughtering his own daughter to fulfill a vow he made to Jehovah.

While we may not think of Judaism as typically promoting human sacrifice, it more than promoted it if we count the genocide Jehovah demanded of the Hebrews. In one day alone, they murdered 12,000 Canaanites “and utterly destroyed everything in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox and sheep and donkey with the edge of the sword.”(Joshua: 6:21)

In Islam, the situation is similar. Allah, while paying lip service to the immorality of human sacrifice, orders his servants in the Koran to practice jihad against all unbelievers. “When the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem of war.” (Koran: 9:5)

Peace-loving Moslems interpret such passages as “symbolic” in their desire to justify their faith, much as Christians try to justify Jehovah’s sociopathic behavior with excuses. In many ways, the god of Islam reasons and rants like the god of the Israelites. Could it be the same entity? It isn’t contradictory that he would support two separate peoples, then lead them to fight each other. Not if his agenda is to stimulate and harvest plenty of loosh.

Christianity, the religion of brotherly love, is implicated in blood sacrifice by being rooted in the Jewish tradition. The Bible declares Jesus is the son of God (Jehovah), and Jehovah announces at Jesus’ baptism, “This is My beloved Son in whom I am well-pleased.” (Matthew: 17:5) Where was Jesus when his father was slaughtering the Canaanites? Jesus himself becomes a blood sacrifice, a fact that Catholics reenact in the mass and that Protestants bathe themselves in to be “saved.” Christians are no strangers to sacrifice.

If suffering and death were part of creation that no one, including the gods, could help, there’d be some reason to be more forgiving. I might even buy the story that they need us to support them with our homage and we need them to keep the universe running. But when you add blood sacrifice into the equation, I abandon ship. It’s one thing if the gods can’t prevent earthly suffering and death – quite another if they seek it out and thrive from it – or worse yet, created it. And that’s what blood sacrifice, and the scriptures around it, indicate.

When the oldest scriptures of the world tell us we were created as food for the gods, I have to ask myself if I want to live in a universe where that might be true. The fact is, I don’t. I can no longer give my approval to that kind of reality. So if I won’t live with it, I have to come up with something better. I have to find something more fundamental than the physical universe to locate my identity in, and my power in. I sense, as many do these days, that there’s something beyond the universe as it has been presented to us, something outside this box, outside this system. That’s what I seek to know, connect with, and draw from.

Robert Morning Sky, a truth seeker of the Hopi and Apache traditions, tells a story he learned from his people about a race of beings who knew no limitations, who existed far outside this physical universe. One day one of them declared his intention to visit Earth and take on a body just for the adventure of it, for the experience. His friends cautioned him, as this universe had a reputation as amnesia-producing, a place of no return. But the entity laughed that off and promised to come back after one lifetime.

Centuries passed, and the entity never came home. One of his comrades decided to enter the physical world to go look for his friend. He promised not to get lost in matter and to return with the other individual. More centuries passed, and neither being returned. So another immortal entered physical mass, and he also never came back. In time many members of these unlimited beings incarnated in human form, and the story goes, none of them yet has gone home.

Maybe we are those people, starting to remember who we are. Maybe it’s time to break out of the hypnosis we’ve lived under for eons, the unquestioned assumptions that we must kill and eat, suffer and die, live in lack and sadness, and undergo all the human drama as it has been defined for us.

Is it insane to think that humans can beat the system? That we could make a choice to stop the activities that supply our up-line with fuel? That we could minimize – even stop – our own refueling from the life force of creatures lower than us on the food chain? Is it madness to think that our bodies, made of undying energy, could themselves not have to die, that we might learn to live on the power of infinite consciousness, which we can access within ourselves, being part of it?

While some may call that madness, I prefer it to the world I see around me. I certainly prefer it to death. I prefer it to loss of my dear ones, and to sickness and poverty. The greatest experiment mankind can engage in is mastery of the principles of freedom, creation, abundance, and immortality. We’re wearing body suits that in 70-some years of use are programmed to self-destruct. What could be more important than changing that programming?

In the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna warns: “He who does not follow the wheel thus set revolving lives in vain.” The wheel is the cycle of birth and death, karma and retribution, human sacrifice and divine blessing. To rebel against this system is to fail in our life purpose as defined by those who say they are our creators and gods. But surely life was meant to be more than dinner for the next rung up on the food chain. If “living in vain” means breaking out of that, I’m all for that kind of failure.

I will go with Thomas Warren Campbell (a physicist, lecturer, and author who worked close with Monroe): Monroe grew up on a farm. His background influenced how he interpreted the data. 

We are not the highest in the food chain. This may be somber/sober. But our possibilities are endless. Everything is love. This is all I know and all my data showed so far in 20 years. And I think that’s a good end.




Love
